==============

Introduction
--------------
TBD: information on EBU AME cards initiative and FIMS-AME...

This repository collects all documents related to the EBU AME cards definition. On the one side, it contains the XML schema describing the formal structure of the cards. It also contains the cards itself, separated in a single card per XML file.

Structure of the repository
--------------
The repository consists of 2 folders:
- _schema_ contains the xml schema file for the AME cards descriptions
- _cards_ contains the xml files representing the AME cards. It is organised as one file per AME card. A list of cards can be found on the EBU workspace of the MIM-SCAIE group: https://workspace.ebu.ch/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=98678281
